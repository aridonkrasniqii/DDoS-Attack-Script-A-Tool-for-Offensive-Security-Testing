# What are DoS and DDoS attacks? 

Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are malicious attempts to disrupt the normal operations of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of Internet traffic. 

DoS attacks accomplish this disruption by sending malicious traffic from a single machine — typically a computer.__
DDoS attacks, meanwhile, use more than one machine to send malicious traffic to their target. Often, these machines are part of a botnet — a collection of computers or other devices that have been infected with malware and can thus be controlled remotely by an individual attacker.__
